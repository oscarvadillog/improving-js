# Improving JS

This repo has been created to improve and practice my JavaScript skills.

## Examples

### WebSocket API

This is a simple WebSocket server based on Node.js in order to learn how the WebSocket API works.

Start the WebSocket server:

```shell
npm run websocket:server
```

On the client side you can either run the command below or open the [web example](websocket/web.html) file

```shell
npm run websocket:client
```
